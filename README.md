# cisco-router-mode
Major mode for editing Cisco router configuration files

I'm going to see if I can create color coding for router/switch configuraiton files as I'm learning to use EMACS.

Goals:
 - learn more about using EMACS and eLISP
 - Router, Switch and Firewall configuration highlighting

Using this as a starting point as it's pretty limited in the highlighting but I like the idea of indents and such and that part works.
